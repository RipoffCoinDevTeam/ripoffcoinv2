Contributing to Ripoff Coin
============================

The Ripoff coin operates a strictly lambo & hooker based contribution model - you want to contribute to our code you need to contribute to our lambo & hooker funds. We know its a privilege to be able to contribute so we are sure you will all want to contribute generously. We will take whole lambos (ideally in pink but we can get them reprayed if required), hookers that are certified clean or just plain bitcoin (we understand some countries frown upon people trafficking). BTC contributions to this address please 1P2W4X3bDg6AinJCVNEALNU7jgY7wFJ9px.

Contributor Workflow
--------------------

The codebase is maintained using the “contributor workflow” where everyone without exception contributes patch proposals using “pull requests”. Before any patch will be considered you must have contributed as above.

The workflow is as follows:

  - Contibute a lambo, hooker or BTC (0.1 min to 1P2W4X3bDg6AinJCVNEALNU7jgY7wFJ9px)
