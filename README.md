===============================

What is Ripoff Coin?
----------------

Still not getting rich over night?, damn it! You've not learned a single thing and you’re still bagholding coins that are obvious scams?, even after we have tried to educate you? Think pump and dump is some kind of colon cleanser? It’s 2017 and you still assume some anonymous “devs” posting on Bitcointalk are “devs” that can code and aren't the same "devs" that scammed you last time? We can help! Join the community where you know it's really gonna hurt. RipoffCoin. It's 100% transparent, we're gonna try to Rip you Off! 

Enjoy this experience, again!

For more information, as well as an immediately useable, binary version of
the Ripoff Coin software (guarenteed to be riddled with BTC stealing trojans), see http://ripoffcoin.com/ (or at least they will be there when we get round to uploading them!)

It should be noted that we basically ripped off Dash for this and copy/paste hacked around with the mining algorithm (hope it works!). So you will find lots of references to dash all over the place, we have left them in out of respect for teh dash devs and definitely not because we couldnt work out to get rid of them...

Building
----------------

Instructions how to compile here, but in the mean time some amazing song lyrics we ripped off....

I like big butts and I can not lie

You other brothers can't deny

That when a girl walks in with an itty bitty waist

And a round thing in your face

You get sprung, want to pull up tough

'Cause you notice that butt was stuffed

Deep in the jeans she's wearing

I'm hooked and I can't stop staring

Oh baby, I want to get wit'cha

And take your picture

My homeboys tried to warn me

But with that butt you got makes (me so horny)

Ooh, Rump-o'-smooth-skin

You say you want to get in my Benz?

Well, use me, use me

'Cause you ain't that average groupie

I've seen her dancin'

To hell with romancin'

She's sweat, wet,

Got it goin' like a turbo 'Vette

I'm tired of magazines

Sayin' flat butts are the thing

Take the average black man and ask him that

She gotta pack much back

So, fellas (yeah) Fellas (yeah)

Has your girlfriend got the butt? (hell yeah)

Tell 'em to shake it (shake it) shake it (shake it)

Shake that healthy butt

Baby got back (L.A. fits with the Oakland booty)

Development Process
-------------------

The `master` branch is meant to be stable, but it probably isnt going to be - who knows what state our development team left it in, or if they even remebered to create a master branch! Development is normally done in separate branches.

The contribution workflow is described in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

Testing
-------

Testing and code review is not something we think we need. Code review has been thoroughly carried out by out development team, there is no need to review anything for yourself as we pinky promise no to have invluded and surprises in the code - we just tell you about all of them up front!
